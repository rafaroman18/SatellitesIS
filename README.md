# SatellitesIS
Final Practice of the subject Intelligent Systems
This is the task we have to implement on Matlab:

On a bidimensional _AxB_ there N posible stations which we have to select **M** representant stations of the rest (N>M):S={R1,R2,...,Rm}.

A station Ri of the subset S is representant of another no selected station when the euclid distance is less than than any other member Rj from S. The position of the N stations is static and is set at the begin of the problem.

We pretend to find the representant station combination which minimize the global euclid distance of this problem.
 


We will do this by Taboo algorithm and Genetic Algorithms.
